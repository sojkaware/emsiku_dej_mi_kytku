## Image to Model

### Request

- type: This field must be set to image_to_model.
- model_version (Optional): Model version. Available versions are as below:  Turbo-v1.0-20250506 v3.0-20250812 v2.5-20250123 v2.0-20240919 v1.4-20240625 v1.3-20240522 (Deprecated)  If this option is not set, the default value will be v2.5-20250123.
- file: Specifies the image input. The resolution of each image must be between 20 x 20px and 6000 x 6000px. The suggested resolution should be more than 256 x 256px  type: Indicates the file type. Although currently not validated, specifying the correct file type is strongly advised. file_token: The identifier you get from upload, please read Docs/Upload. Mutually exclusive with url and object. url: A direct URL to the image. Supports JPEG and PNG formats with maximum size of 20MB. Mutually exclusive with file_token and object. object (Strongly Recommended): The information you get from upload (STS), please read Docs/Upload (STS). Mutually exclusive with url and file_token. bucket: Normally should be tripo-data. key: The resource_uri got from session token.
- model_seed (Optional): This is the random seed for model generation. For model_version>=v2.0-20240919, the seed controls the geometry generation process, ensuring identical models when the same seed is used. This parameter is an integer and is randomly chosen if not set.
- enable_image_autofix (Optional): When set to true, it will optimize the input image to get better generation result. It will take longer time when request. The default value is false.

The options below are only valid for model_version>=v2.0-20240919

- face_limit (Optional): Limits the number of faces on the output model. If this option is not set, the face limit will be adaptively determined. If smart_low_poly=true, it should be 1000~20000, if quad=true as well, it should be 500~10000.
- texture (Optional): A boolean option to enable texturing. The default value is true, set false to get a base model without any textures.
- pbr (Optional): A boolean option to enable pbr. The default value is true, set false to get a model without pbr. If this option is set to true, texture will be ignored and used as true.
- texture_seed (Optional): This is the random seed for texture generation for model_version>=v2.0-20240919. Using the same seed will produce identical textures. This parameter is an integer and is randomly chosen if not set. If you want a model with different textures, please use same model_seed and different texture_seed.
- texture_alignment (Optional): Determines the prioritization of texture alignment in the 3D model. The default value is original_image. original_image: Prioritizes visual fidelity to the source image. This option produces textures that closely resemble the original image but may result in minor 3D inconsistencies. geometry: Prioritizes 3D structural accuracy. This option ensures better alignment with the model’s geometry but may cause slight deviations from the original image appearance.
- texture_quality (Optional): This parameter controls the texture quality. detailed provides high-resolution textures, resulting in more refined and realistic representation of intricate parts. This option is ideal for models where fine details are crucial for visual fidelity. The default value is standard.
- auto_size (Optional): Automatically scale the model to real-world dimensions, with the unit in meters. The default value is false.

- orientation (Optional): Set orientation=align_image to automatically rotate the model to align the original image. The default value is default.
- quad (Optional): Set true to enable quad mesh output. If quad=true and face_limit is not set, the default face_limit will be 10000. Note: Enabling this option will force the output to be an FBX model.
- compress (Optional): Specifies the compression type to apply to the texture. Available values are: geometry: Applies geometry-based compression to optimize the output, By Default we use meshopt compression
- smart_low_poly (Optional): Generate low-poly meshes with hand‑crafted topology. Inputs with less complexity work best. There is a possibility of failure for complex models. The default value is false.
- generate_parts (Optional): Generate segmented 3D models and make each part editable. The default value is false. Note: generate_parts is not compatible with texture=true or pbr=true, if you want to generate parts, please set texture=false and pbr=false; generate_parts is not compatible with quad=true, if you want to generate parts, please set quad=false.
- export_uv (Optional): Controls whether UV unwrapping is performed during generation. The default value is true. (When set to false, generation speed is significantly improved and model size is reduced. UV unwrapping will be handled during the texturing stage.)

The options below are only valid for model_version>=v3.0-20250812

- geometry_quality (Optional): Ultra Mode: Maximum detail for the most intricate and realistic models when setting to detailed Standard Mode: Balanced detail and speed. The default value is standard

## Multiview to Model

### Request

- type: This field must be set to multiview_to_model.
- model_version (Optional): Model version. Available versions are as below:  v3.0-20250812 v2.5-20250123 v2.0-20240919 v1.4-20240625(Deprecated)  If this option is not set, the default value will be v2.5-20250123.
- files: Specifies the image inputs, this is a list contains following parameters. The list must contain exactly 4 items in the order [front, left, back, right]. You may omit certain input files by omitting the file_token, but the front input cannot be omitted. Do not use less than two images to generate. The resolution of each image must be between 20 x 20px and 6000 x 6000px. The suggested resolution should be more than 256 x 256px  type: Indicates the file type. Although currently not validated, specifying the correct file type is strongly advised. file_token: The identifier you get from upload, please read Docs/Upload. Mutually exclusive with url and object. url: A direct URL to the image. Supports JPEG and PNG formats with maximum size of 20MB. Mutually exclusive with file_token and object. object (Strongly Recommended): The information you get from upload (STS), please read Docs/Upload (STS). Mutually exclusive with url and file_token. bucket: Normally should be tripo-data. key: The resource_uri got from session token.
- face_limit (Optional): Limits the number of faces on the output model. If this option is not set, the face limit will be adaptively determined. If smart_low_poly=true, it should be 1000~20000, if quad=true as well, it should be 500~10000.
- texture (Optional): A boolean option to enable texturing. The default value is true, set false to get a base model without any textures.
- pbr (Optional): A boolean option to enable pbr. The default value is true, set false to get a model without pbr. If this option is set to true, texture will be ignored and used as true.
- texture_seed (Optional): This is the random seed for texture generation. Using the same seed will produce identical textures. This parameter is an integer and is randomly chosen if not set. If you want a model with different textures, please use same model_seed and different texture_seed.
- texture_alignment (Optional): Determines the prioritization of texture alignment in the 3D model. The default value is original_image.  original_image: Prioritizes visual fidelity to the source image. This option produces textures that closely resemble the original image but may result in minor 3D inconsistencies. geometry: Prioritizes 3D structural accuracy. This option ensures better alignment with the model’s geometry but may cause slight deviations from the original image appearance.
- texture_quality (Optional): This parameter controls the texture quality. detailed provides high-resolution textures, resulting in more refined and realistic representation of intricate parts. This option is ideal for models where fine details are crucial for visual fidelity. The default value is standard.
- auto_size (Optional): Automatically scale the model to real-world dimensions, with the unit in meters. The default value is false.
- orientation (Optional): Set orientation=align_image to automatically rotate the model to align the original image. The default value is default.
- quad (Optional): Set true to enable quad mesh output. If quad=true and face_limit is not set, the default face_limit will be 10000.  Note: Enabling this option will force the output to be an FBX model.
- compress (Optional): Specifies the compression type to apply to the texture. Available values are:  geometry: Applies geometry-based compression to optimize the output, By default we use meshopt compression.
- smart_low_poly (Optional): Generate low-poly meshes with hand‑crafted topology. Inputs with less complexity work best. There is a possibility of failure for complex models. The default value is false.
- generate_parts (Optional): Generate segmented 3D models and make each part editable. The default value is false.  Note: generate_parts is not compatible with texture=true or pbr=true, if you want to generate parts, please set texture=false and pbr=false; generate_parts is not compatible with quad=true, if you want to generate parts, please set quad=false.
- export_uv (Optional): Controls whether UV unwrapping is performed during generation. The default value is true. (When set to false, generation speed is significantly improved and model size is reduced. UV unwrapping will be handled during the texturing stage.)

Note: The directions of object in images should be [0°, 90°, 180°, 270°] and the object should be consistent among these images. left means the left arm of the input character for example.

| FRONT | LEFT | BACK | RIGHT |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

The options below are only valid for model_version>=v3.0-20250812

- geometry_quality (Optional): Ultra Mode: Maximum detail for the most intricate and realistic models when setting to detailed Standard Mode: Balanced detail and speed. The default value is standard

### Response

- task_id: The identifier for the successfully submitted task.

### Behaviour

You can expect the same behaviour with text to model.

## Refine Model

### Request

- type: This field must be set to refine_model.
- draft_model_task_id: The task_id of a draft model. Only the task IDs of the tasks below are supported: text_to_model image_to_model multiview_to_model

Note: models of model_version>=v2.0-20240919 for refine is not supported.

### Response

- task_id: The identifier for the successfully submitted task.

### Behaviour

The refinement process, being considerably more complex than initial drafting, yields a lower throughput and necessitates longer wait times, which are typically about 2 minutes in addition to queueing time.

We are actively enhancing our system to improve performance, which may cause these figures to vary over time. If you require increased throughput, please contact us for further assistance.
